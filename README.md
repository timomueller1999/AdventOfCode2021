The programs that I use to solve the puzzles of Advent Of Code 2021. Usually, there are a few files per day, named by the following convention:
- `dd-1-sample_input.txt`
- `dd-1-input.txt`
- `dd-1-prog.py`
- `dd-2-prog.py`
`dd` is the two-digit day. The first two contain the sample input and the puzzle input, respectively, for part 1 of the puzzle. `dd-1-prog.py` contains a program to solve part 1 of the puzzle. `dd-1-prog.py` contains a program to solve part 2 of the puzzle.  
The file name `dd-1-input.txt` is hard-written into the source code.  
If the input for part 2 is different from the input for part 1, then there are possibly additional files, named `dd-2-sample_input.txt` and `dd-2-input.txt`.
